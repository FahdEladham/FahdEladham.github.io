                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>During this year at <a href="https://mounttemple.ie/" target="_blank">Mount Temple</a>, I've gone on a few trips for TY. They've been the highlight of this year for me, so I made this website to talk about them. I'll be writing about a few of my favorites, and I hope you enjoy!</p>

            <div id="KilmainhamJail">
                <h2>Kilmainham Jail</h2>
                <p>On the 18th of October, the Cultural Studies class went on a trip to <a href="https://www.kilmainhamgaolmuseum.ie/" target="_blank">Kilmainham Jail</a>. After taking the 123 bus, we walked to Kilmainham Jail where we got a full tour of the place. We toured the chapel, the stonebreakers' yard, and both the west wing and the east wing. We visited the cells of prisoners from the 1916 rising and viewed the museum. It was my first time at Kilmainham Jail, and I’d recommend it to everyone!</p>

                <h2>Beach Coastal Study</h2>
                <p>On Monday, the 16th of September 2024, the whole year group went to Shankill Beach for a day of studying the beach. It didn’t start off well, as the first Dart that came to pick us up was full, and nobody could get on. After the next Dart arrived and we spent 40 minutes on it, we finally reached the beach and got into our groups.</p>
                <p>We started off with Ms. Corry and threw oranges into the sea to calculate the forces of the south-blowing winds. The experiment didn’t work properly, and it was extremely boring.</p>
                <p>Next, we went with Ms. O'Brien, where we tested how long it took for water to filter the further it was from the sea. None of our experiments worked well, so we faked our results, and in the end, Ms. O'Brien made everyone copy our fake results, which was pretty funny!</p>
                <p>After that, we went on a break. Most of the year went to the café next to the beach to buy drinks, as it was the closest shop to us. After the break, we went with Mr. McMahon to do something, but I honestly didn’t understand a single thing we did there.</p>
                <p>At the end of the day, it was kind of fun, albeit boring at times, but I’m glad I went in the end.</p>

            <div id="CauseyFarm">
                <h2>Causey Farm</h2>
                <p>On the 19th of September, the whole year group ventured out on a trip to <a href="https://www.causey.ie/" target="_blank">Causey Farm</a>. After a 2-hour bus ride, we arrived at Causey Farm, where we were split into groups of 20. My group started by making pizza dough for the pizzas we were going to have later that day. I partnered with Louis, and we did a stellar job on our dough!</p>
                <p>Afterward, we moved to a petting farm where we encountered a wild variety of animals like llamas, dogs, rabbits, donkeys, horses, chickens, and cows. We got to feed some of the animals, which was cool.</p>
                <p>Next, we went through a series of tunnels with three levels: easy, medium, and hard. I blitzed through all the tunnels in record time with Louis. I would recommend it if you’re not claustrophobic, as the tunnels were very tight.</p>
                <p>Once we finished there, we got to finally eat our pizzas, and not to brag, but my pizza was the best one by far.</p>
                <p>For our final activity, we went bog jumping. Before jumping in, it was a bit scary because I couldn’t tell how deep it was. But after Raf jumped, I did too, and everyone followed. It was an absolute blast and the highlight of the trip!</p>
